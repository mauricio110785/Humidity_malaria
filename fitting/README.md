# Urban Malaria role of humidity

# R codes for model fitting

`pomp_object_RH.R`: It creates the object of class pomp (see [link](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/getting_started.html) for details on how to use the R package pomp) for the model with Relative humidity. The models with the Temperature and rainfall will follow the same structure

`param_creatGrid.R`: It creates the initial set of parameters for the initial search.

`mif_Search_first_RH_model.R`: The initial search of parameter space was performed using the grid generated by `param_creatGrid.R`. This exampla show the process for the relative humidity model. The output of this search is then used as the initial conditions of a more refined search. 

`mifRefine1_TmeanB.R`: It repeats the search of parameter space using the output of `mif_Search_first_RH_model.R` until the maximum likelihood value was stationary. 

`profiling_example.R`: This code contains an example of a profile likelihood estimation using the RH (relative humidity model) the same process was followed for the rest of the models.
