# Urban Malaria role of humidity

# R codes for model fitting

`poObject_RH.R`: creates the object of class pomp (see [link](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/getting_started.html) for details on how to use the R package pomp) for the model with Relative Humidity. The models with the either Temperature or Rainfall as drivers will follow a similar formulation, 

`param_creatGrid.R`: creates the  set of parameters to initialize the initial search.

`mif_Search_first_RH_model.R`: The initial search in parameter space was performed using the grid generated by `param_creatGrid.R`. This example shows the steps for the relative humidity model. The output of this search is then used as the initial conditions of a more refined search. 

`mif_Search_refined_RH_model.R`: repeats the search of parameters using the output of  `mif_Search_first_RH_model.R` until the maximum likelihood value becomes stationary. 

`profiling_example.R`: This code contains an example of a profile likelihood estimation using the RH (relative humidity) model.  The same process was followed for the other models.
